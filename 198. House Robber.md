### 题意
You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

### 思路

反正就是给你一个数组，从数组里取数，但是不能取连续的两个数，求可以取到的最大值。首先考虑动态规划，最优子结构，OPT[i]表示到位置i所取的数的总和的最大值，则
OPT[i] = max{OPT[i - 1], OPT[i - 2] + nums[i]}
就是这么简单。

### 代码

```
class Solution {
public:
    int rob(vector<int> &num) {
        if (num.size() <= 1) return num.empty() ? 0 : num[0];
        vector<int> dp = {num[0], max(num[0], num[1])};
        for (int i = 2; i < num.size(); ++i) {
            dp.push_back(max(num[i] + dp[i - 2], dp[i - 1]));
        }
        return dp.back();
    }
};
```
